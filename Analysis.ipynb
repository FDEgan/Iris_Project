You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.  \n",

    "1. **Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.**\n",

    "3. **Write a program called analysis.py that:**\n",
    "   1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,\n",
    "   2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and\n",

    "4. **Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.**\n",

    "You may produce a Jupyter notebook as well containing all your comment. This notebook should only contain text that you have written yourself, (it may contain referenced code from other sources). I will harshly mark any text (not code) that I feel is not written directly by you. I want to know what YOU think, not some third party. Please make sure the style of your documentation is consistent. It might help to suppose that your manager has asked you to investigate the data set, with a view to explaining it to your colleagues. Imagine that you are to give a presentation on the data set in a few weeks’ time, where you explain what investigating a data set entails and how Python can be used to do it. You have not been asked to create a deck of presentation slides, but rather to present your code and its output to them.\n"
